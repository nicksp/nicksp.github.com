                <p>
                  We are a team of skilled app developers, UI and UX designers, product strategists and marketers, who
                  understand what makes people and mobile apps click.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  At FSA, we don't just build apps. We create the kind of apps that people talk about, that they use
                  over and over again. We eat, sleep, and breathe mobile. It's who we are.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We do strategy, design, and development for iPhone apps and Android apps. We work for startups and
                  enterprise alike. We also know a thing or two about websites, and services.

                <h3>Product Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                  Think of us like your senior product team you never thought you could afford. We're a bunch of
                  strategists, UX designers, coders and product managers who bring hands on expertise based on years and
                  years of experience in building, launching and growing mobile products. We always focus on the value
                  for the user your product needs to create and the risks that your MVP needs to mitigate. We work lean
                  and push for real data instead of guesses.

                <h3>UX & UI Design</h3>
                <p>
                  We try to design products that solve specific needs for the users. That means understanding the users
                  first and building empathy before anything else. Our UX & UI designs work closely with you to go from
                  understanding the experiences we need to create for the users, to building the wireframes, prototyping
                  and doing a remarkable user interface. The visible UI design is just the tip of a deep iceberg, where
                  the real value sits.

                <h3>Native App Development</h3>
                <p>
                  To build native means to use all the capabilities of the mobile devices. It means not to compromise on
                  experience you create for the user. And eventually means a solid foundation for scaling up and turning
                  a mobile product into a real business. We use Swift for iOS and Java for Android, with a sheer focus
                  on performance and clean code.

                <h3>Back-end and Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                  Our focus to build full-stack mobile products meant hiring experienced backend and web developers to
                  complete the rest of the product team. And that paid up a lot, as now we can have integrated teams in
                  house, covering all the components of your product, from front-end to back-end, from design to product
                  management. And you don't really know what difference that makes in delivering projects in time and
                  budget until you've done it.
